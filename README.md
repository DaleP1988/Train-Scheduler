# **Train Scheduler**

Train Scheduler is a web app written in Javascript that uses Moment.js to retrieve and format train data. Incoming data is hosted on Firebase and displays on an HTML page. Train Scheduler can take user input scheduling data and calculate the estimated time of arrival for the next train on the new schedule. Train Scheduler is deployed on Github!


## **How to Use Train Scheduler:**

Click on the following link to test out Train Scheduler: [Train Scheduler](). 
From the main page you can view the currently displayed train schedules, or add a new schedule. If you are adding a new schedule, complete the fields for Train Name, Destination, Time and Frequency. When you hit submit, your new schedule will be added to Firebase and appear in the Train Schedules window. Train Scheduler will determine and display the estimated time of arrival for the next train on your schedule.
